"""
Best-effort IP geolocation for the admin panel's "source IP" column.

Uses ip-api.com's free batch endpoint (no key required; http only on the
free tier - https needs a paid plan). Results are cached in the
ip_geo_cache DB table so this only ever runs for IPs we haven't resolved
recently. The admin panel polls /api/peers every few seconds, so this must
never block that loop on a flaky third-party API - every failure mode here
is swallowed and just means "no location shown", never a broken panel.
